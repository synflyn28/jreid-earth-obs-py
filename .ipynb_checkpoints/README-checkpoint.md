# Python for Earth Observation Pratice

This repository contains my practice for Rebeka B. Esmaili's *Earth Observation Using Python: A Practical Guide*.
It reproduces the code examples for manipulating and and visualizing Earth Science data from NOAA, NASA and
other public resources. The reference repository I used to replicate these results is located [here](https://github.com/resmaili/Earth-Obs-Py).
